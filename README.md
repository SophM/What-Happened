# What Happened?!

In this project, I built "What Happened?!" - an app that allows us to scrape news articles from the New York Times webiste. The user can then save the ones she/he wants and once an article is saved, she/he can add notes on it. "What Happened?!" has a responsive layout (see GIF below) and renders well on computers, tablets and mobiles. It has been deployed to Heroku.

The news articles scrapped and the notes are stored in a **MongoDB database using a mLab provision**. The data are thus persistent and will be displayed on the app as long as they aren't deleted from the database itself.
